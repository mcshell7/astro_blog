	<p>Hello! I’m Mykhailo Khamardiuk, a passionate and experienced Web Developer with a strong focus on creating user-friendly, responsive, and visually appealing websites. Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in front-end development, specializing in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and modern frameworks like Astro.</p>
	<h4 id="-my-journey-"><strong>My Journey</strong></h4>
	<p>My journey in web development began in 2019 when I started as a Full Stack Developer at Web Technologies in Khmelnitskiy, Ukraine. There, I worked closely with clients and fellow developers to create custom websites from scratch, catering to diverse industries and requirements. My experience with Diafan CMS provided me with a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end development.</p>
	<p>In 2021, I transitioned to a role as a Front-End Developer at Siteplus in Kyiv, Ukraine. At Siteplus, I was part of a dynamic team that developed a powerful website builder tailored for hosting companies, domain registrars, telcos, and agencies. This role not only deepened my expertise in front-end technologies but also exposed me to the intricacies of building scalable and user-centric web applications.</p>
	<p>Most recently, I worked as a Freelance Web Developer for ADA Mobile Agency in Charlotte, NC, from January 2023 to May 2024. During this time, I developed complex user interfaces and ensured a seamless user experience across various platforms. My work involved both front-end and back-end development, allowing me to contribute to every stage of the project lifecycle—from gathering requirements to deploying fully functional applications.</p>
